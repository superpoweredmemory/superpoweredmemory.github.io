            <h1> Superpowered Memory </h1>
            <h2> A Research-Based Course on How To Master Your Memory</h2>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Do you kill yourself studying but don't get the grades you think you deserve?</h3>
            <h3>Does it feel like even after studying so hard you quickly forget what you learned?</h3>
            <h3>Do you feel overwhelmed with the amount of things you have to learn?</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Many students experience these problems in their lives. They do everything they've been told to do yet they still can't get the results they want. Exams never go as well as they were hoping, and they quickly forget everything they spent so much time learning.</p>
          <p>I want to convice you it doesn't have to be this way.</p>
          <p><b>The science of learning and memory is one of the incredible successes in psychology</b>. For decades researchers have been hard at work trying to understand how our memories work and the results are nothing short of amazing. Our memories well tuned machines that work according to well understood principles that can be taken advantage of. <b>We now know what we have to do to never forget</b>.</p>
          <p> <b>Yet we're never taught this</b>. We are expected to spend several years in school learning but we're never taught how to learn! Isn't that weird? Most of us just wing it. We see how other, more successful, people study, thinking they must have figured out something we haven't, yet we never seem to get the same results they do. Worse yet, researchers have known for a while that the techniques a lot of students use daily simply do not work, yet we never learn about what we're supposed to do instead.</p>
          <p><b> I want to teach you a better way to learn.</b></p>
          <p>This online course is the culmination of six years of reading the every single paper, chapter, and book I could find on how our memories work and what we can do to improve them. Like you, I was tired of spending so much time studying and never getting the grades I wanted. I was tired, and to be honest, I was angry at myself. Why couldn't I get better grades than others who didn't spend as much time studying as I did?</p>
          <p> I read everything I could find on the Internet about how to learn, but for every nugget of insight I had to wade through a whole lot of junk. It was when I decided to start reading what the scientific community had to say about our memory that I knew I had hit the jackpot. There was so much that I did not know about! Working memory? What is that? Spacing your studying instead of massing it in the week before the exam has been proven to work wonders? Why is no one talking about this?
          <p>Superpowered Memory is my attempt to rectify this. Too many students are wasting too much time using techniques that simply do not work.</p>
          <p>You deserve better, there's too much at stake.</p>

          <h3>How to Make Sure You Never Forget Again</h3>
          <p>Superpowered Memory is a course on how to leverage the research findings of how memory works to supercharge the learning process. I want to teach you not only how you can learn better, but how to learn smarter.</p>
          <p>In this course you will learn:</p>
            <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> What is known on how memory works and what this implies about how we should learn</h4>
            <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> The science of how we forget and how you can use spacing and testing to form longer lasting memories</h4>
            <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> How to use Spaced Repetition Systems like Anki for more effective learning</h4>
            <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> How to use these principles in practice, using examples from Medicine, Economics, and Chemistry.</h4>
            <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Tips on making sure you continue using what you've learned here throughout your life</h4>
