            <h1>The Biggest Misconception About Memory (and What That Means For How You Should Study)</h1>
            <p><p>Why do we have memory? The obvious answer is that having a place to store information about the past is useful as we can use that information to guide us in the future. Without memory we wouldn’t remember where we left the keys of our car, that we left the oven on, or even who we are. More fundamentally, without memory we wouldn’t be able to learn new things. We might even say that learning and memory both sides of the same coin. Without somewhere to store information we wouldn’t be able to learn new things as they wouldn’t have a place to latch onto.</p>

<p>Yet if we are to understand the importance of memory to learning we must make sure that our understanding of it is correct. It might be that memory is where you store information, but that doesn’t tell us how exactly it does those things. Given that knowing how our memory works is a <a href="http://superpoweredmemory.com/becoming-an-effective-leaner">critical component of becoming an effective learner</a>, it is essential that we clear one of the biggest misconceptions regarding how we think about our memories.</p>

<p>What is that misconception? The idea that our memory works like a hard-drive.</p>

<p>A computer hard-drive is the one object whose purpose it is to store information that we are regularly in contact with. That’s where we store our childhood’s photos, the musics we listen to and whatever TV shows where currently watching. Yet, even though both our memories and our computer’s hard drive both serve the purpose of storing information for later use, they differ in fundamental ways.</p>

<p>First off, there are two requirements that our computer’s hard-drive must meet for it to be useful to us:</p>

<p>1 -  It has to store perfectly the information we put in it, and</p>

<p>2 - Whenever we access what is there it must be able to perfectly retrieve what it was stored.</p>

<p>Your memory doesn’t work that way.</p>

<p>First off, your memory stores information not by making any kind of literal recording of that information, but by relating new information by what you already know. This means that it isn’t enough to just superficially read the material you’re trying to learn in the hopes that it will somehow imprint itself into your mind.</p>

<p>Second, when you access a memory you’re not “playing” back that memory as much as you’re reconstructing it. This has been well known since the 30s when Bartlett published his classic on the topic of remembering. The gist of it is that memory retrieval is an inferential and reconstructive process where features of the original memory are stitched together with your assumptions, goals, or prior experience, etc. Try, for example, to get two people who were in a fight for an objective account of what happened and you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>What are the implications of this for how you should approach how you learn new things?</p>

<p>Since your memory doesn’t create a perfect copy of what you’ve learned but instead relates it to what you know, as a first step in your learning process you must be actively engaged with the content you want to remember. When you’re first starting, you should spend your time trying to tease the similarities and differences between what you’re learning with what you already know. If you’re learning about how memory works, a good place to start might be, say, to contrast it with how a hard-drive works.</p>

<p>The hard part starts when you’ve completed the first step. We’ve known for a while that memories, once formed, can be modified. Each time you recall a memory you put it in a state where it can be altered. What researchers found was that if you make an effort trying to recall something, you’re making it so that same memory becomes stronger in your brain. It’s as if that effort you put in tells your brain that this information is important to you, telling him to store that memory because you might need it later.</p>

<p>This has several implications. Given that memories are enhanced when you actively try to recall them, then every time you study you should make sure to allocate some time to test yourself on the material. This isn’t exactly pleasant, as it takes more effort than just rereading things, but the path to <a href="http://superpoweredmemory.com/make-things-hard">greater learning should include some difficulty</a>. It’s how you ensure you aren’t fooling yourself.</p>

<p>A good way to do this is to pick up a piece of paper, stow away your notes and books, and write everything you know about the topic without help. Writing that essay will enhance your learning in a way that is much stronger that any rereading of your notes ever could.</p>
