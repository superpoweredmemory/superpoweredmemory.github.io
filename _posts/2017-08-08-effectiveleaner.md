Learning is a foundational aspect of our lives.

We start early, entering formal education when we're young with some leaving some decades later with a degree or more in their belt. After entering the workforce, we might be forgiven in thinking that our job will consist in nothing more than applying what we already know, that learning new things is at best a tangential task. Yet we are soon disabused of that idea when the reality of the modern workplace is thrust upon us. Things move fast. New technology is always being introduced and old paradigms are always in danger of being overturned. We soon realize that we live in a world where we either continue updating our knowledge or we'll find ourselves stuck in the same place for ever, or worse, becoming obsolete.

I may be exaggerating for effect, but the reality is not that far off. Think back to how the world was 5, 10, 20 years in the past and contrast it to today to see how much can change in so short a period. Can you be certain that your skills will continue to be relevant a decade from now? Or, if you’re still a student, do you think what you’ve learned so far will be enough to get you through the many decades still ahead of you? Probably not. Thus the need to make learning a habitual activity of ours. We must all become perpetual learners, or face the consequences.
There is an added difficulty to all of this however: Most people are terrible learners. It would perhaps be a rosier picture if the truth were that most people are mediocre learners, with some slightly better and some slightly worse, but that’s just not what’s happening. Again and again, what research has found is that people, for the most part, are terrible learners.

One would think, given that we start school so young and must continue to learn new things throughout our lives in some shape or form that we would know how to study in such a way as to promote efficient learning. Yet must of us are never taught how to study. [When asked by researchers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-011-0181-y), 65 to 80% of students answer “no” to the question “Do you study the way you do because somebody taught you to study that way?”. Whether the remaining 20 to 30% study in a way consistent to research findings on how to learn is a different question altogether. What often happens is that we pick up tips and tricks from our peers and use those techniques thinking they must be the best ways to learn. How could they not be if everyone is using them?

Yet these crowdsourced strategies are so ineffective, and so widely used, that researchers have invariably concluded most of us are terrible learners. [As researchers Robert Bjork, John Dunlosky, and Nate Kornell put it](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143823), *“there is in fact much that we, as learners, do not tend to know about how best to assess and manage our own learning.”*

Worse yet is that this ignorance about isn’t easily corrected. One would think that decades spent learning and putting that knowledge to the quite literal test would make it so that bad learning practices would be left by the wayside with only the good practices surviving the ordeal. Yes, other people might be using these techniques but once you yourself see that they aren’t getting you the results you want one would think that you would switch to better techniques. That, however, does not tend to happen. The legions of students armed with nothing but highlighters in libraries worldwide, and the overwhelming evidence against their usage, is a testament to this.

What are we to do then? If learning is so important but we’re terrible at it, does this mean we’re screwed? Is there nothing that can be done? Thankfully, things aren’t so dire. There are general principles and techniques, identified after decades of scientific research on how to learn, that you can use to get much better results.

These are the key principles you must learn to become an effective learner:

#### a) Understanding the peculiarities of human memory and learning
#### b) Knowing the techniques that enhance the storage and retrieval of information from memory
#### c) How to monitor the state of one’s learning and the myriad ways in which our judgments can be fooled

## The peculiarities of human memory

Our first step in the quest to become effective learners is to understand what [Elizabeth and Robert Bjork](https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/07/RBjork_EBjork_1992.pdf) call the “important peculiarities” of human memory. We need to know the way our memories store and retrieve new knowledge so that we can tailor our learning approach to one that enhances those processes.
Our memory doesn’t work like recording device. It is not the brain’s equivalent to a computer hard-drive as it doesn’t store information in our long-term memories by making a bit by bit copy of that information. Instead, it stores new information by its relationship with what we already know, growing stronger the more connections it can create. This means that, as a first approach, our learning process must become an active one where we tease out the relationships between what we’re learning with what we already know instead of taking notes and fervently praying that by some miraculous process they get imprinted in our mind.

Another important thing to know is that the retrieval of information from memory is not without its consequences. Remembering things changes our memories, oftentimes making those retrieved memories stronger. Retrieving information from memory works as a memory modifier, making that memory more recallable in the future, as if the brain figured out that since you selected this one memory against all others it means the information contained within it is important, making it more accessible for when you later need it. In practical terms, this means that making an effort to recall things, by testing yourself for example, will improve your memory in such a way as to make that recall much less effortful, ensuring that when time comes that you need it, in an exam for example, you have an easier time recalling all that knowledge you spent so much time learning.

The remarkable thing, from an historical perspective, is that we’ve known about how our memories form long term memories for centuries now ever since Hermann Ebbinghaus made his initial experiments that established the scientific study of memory. Yet, unless you happen to take a course on memory in college, very few of us learn of any of this. My own course Superpowered Memory is an attempt at rectifying this issue.

## Input less, Output More

Knowing how memory works doesn’t help if we continue to use suboptimal techniques that don’t take that knowledge into account. If our learning strategy continues to be reading the material and highlighting what we deem to be the important sections we will continue to be frustrated when we look back and realize we remember close to nothing. All those arduous hours laboring away in the library will have been for nothing. If we are to become effective learners, we need to leverage our understanding of how we form new memories into the techniques that promote the storage, and subsequent retrieval, of new information.
This means that, as effective leaners, we must eschew passive activities like re-reading and highlighting, and embrace active learning techniques such as deep processing and testing. Our studying will consist in sketching the connections between what we’re learning with what we already know, teasing away the similarities and the ways in which it differs from other things. Additionally, because our goal is to create lasting memories, we will put our notes and books away to test ourselves to see if we remember what it was we were studying. This will lead to much a much deeper understanding than merely re-reading your notes ever would.

Aside from understanding why certain techniques work better than others, to become effective learners we must also understand how to go about applying those techniques because all the knowledge in the world about how to learn won’t help us if we don’t know how to apply it. Knowing that spacing one’s studying sessions, say, throughout a semester, will lead to better and more durable understanding, compared with bunching them for the week right before the exam, will have implications regarding how we plan our studying. Furthermore, knowing that memory retrieval is dependent on the cues available from the environment will make it so that we will vary the environment we are studying to make sure the new memories we are forming are locked in with cues that aren’t available when we most need that knowledge, like in an exam.
As effective learners, we will make sure to follow the most important learning adage there is, originally coined by researcher Robert Bjork: Input Less, Output More!


## Do we know what we know?

Presumably, no one spends hours studying what they already know, but are our judgments of what we know or not know accurate? To become effective learners, we must also become efficient learners, making sure that our time is spent in such a way that learning is achieved and our efforts are not for nothing. Thus the need to make sure our judgments of whether we’ve learned something correspond to the degree to which learning has occurred. One would think that the only way it would feel like we know something would be because we actually know it, but the ways by which our judgments can be misled [are so many as to beggar belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

We are frequently overconfident, [thinking we know something more than we in fact do](http://superpoweredmemory.com/make-things-hard), and the ineffective studying techniques that we mistakenly use further compound on that overconfidence. We equate performance based on fleeting circumstances, such has recalling something after just having read the material, with actual learning.

To become effective learners, we must understand that our judgments of learning are heuristics and are thus subject to systematic biases, such as hindsight bias, the feeling that we knew it all along, and foresight bias, the feeling that because we know it now we will know it in the future. Given our knowledge of these biases, we know not to trust our judgments too much unless they come from our performance in the activities that actually matter. Thus our extensive use of testing and generation, because the only accurate way of knowing if we know something is by actually demonstrating that we know it.

Being an effective learner is not an easy task. It takes work to implement these techniques, and they’re often more mentally taxing than just re-reading things. Having to be on constant alert as to whether our judgments of learning are impaired by biases or not can be difficult as it means going against our own conscious experiences or feelings that we do know something. Yet given the increased importance of learning across the lifespan, that increased difficulty will pay of when you find yourself in a better situation than you would have been otherwise. These added difficulties are what will make sure that your goals are achieved, and hence the way to think about them is as an investment.

You put the work now so that the rewards can be reaped later.
