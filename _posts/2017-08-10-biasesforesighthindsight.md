How many times has it happened to you that the grade of an exam you had thought you aced comes back lower than you were expecting? You were so sure you had done a great job that you’re sure the teacher must have gotten it wrong. She just didn't understand what you were trying to say. You go to her office to ask if you could take a look at the exam to see what you’re grade was so low. She searches for the exam and hands it over to you. You start reading what you wrote for one of the answers, which, embarrassingly,  is marked all over in red, a bad sign, yet you can't tell what's wrong with it. You ask her if she could explain what was it got wrong and, after she does, it hits you just how dumb you were. It was so obvious! How could have you gotten it wrong? Just the day before you'd been going through your notes on this. It must have been a fluke! The only reason you’d gotten it wrong was because of some weird inexplicable reason that made it so that you didn’t remember the right answer! It must have been it, right?

We humans are easily misled. That's an uncontroversial statement by itself, we've all been wrong or made a mistake some way or another, but what I mean by this is that not only are we often mistaken, but we are also blind to shoe same mistakes. Take the Linda Problem, created by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman to show how easy it is to trip up our reasoning skills:

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Which is more probable?

#### 1 -  Linda is a bank teller

#### 2 -  Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

What would you answer?

If you chose option 2, you'll be surprised to know that that’s not the right answer, but don’t worry, most people make the same mistake. Why is option 2 incorrect? Recall that both options 1 and 2 include the possibility that Linda is a bank teller but only option 2 introduces a further restriction, that of Linda being active in the feminist movement, meaning that if 2 is true then 1 is also true , but not the other way around. Thus, the more probable option is the option 1. This type of mistake is called the conjunction fallacy, when we assume that a specific condition is more probable than a more general one.

What tends to happen is that people cling on to the information provided, making judgments about the type of person Linda is and bringing those judgments with them when evaluating which option is more probable when that knowledge is at best circumstantial to the question asked. Stephen Jay Gould, the eminent biologist, was to say *"I am particularly fond of this example because I know that the [conjoint] statement is least probable, yet a little homunculus in my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me—“but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description.”*

Of course, this is just a single example of the types of mistakes we often make, but a quick glimpse at the extent of this [list of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that plague our thinking and decision making should make clear the extent of the problem we face.

If our goal is to [become effective learners](http://superpoweredmemory.com/becoming-an-effective-leaner), then we must learn what sort of biases are likely to rear their head when we're trying to learn something new so that we can find ways to neutralize them.

The main way that biases can affect us our learning is by impairing our judgments of whether we have actually learned something or not. Think back to that initial exam example. First there was this sense that you must have gotten the answer right, you were sure of it, but once shown you were wrong and what you should have answered instead, you thought you knew it all along! That can't possibly be the case or you would have answered correctly in the first place. Something must have happened that impeded you to judge correctly whether you knew something, making you overconfident in your judgment that you knew it when you didn't. Then, further compounding on that misjudgment, when the teacher told you what the correct answer was you inferred that you knew it all along! This is another misjudgment since it's highly unlikely that just because you were shown the correct answer you will recall it again when you need it again, maybe in a future exam.

There are a variety of possible biases that can creep up on us when we're trying to learn something new but there are two big ones that you must always be on alert to make sure you don’t follow into a trap: the hindsight and foresight biases, or the "I-knew-it-all-along" tendency and the "I-will-know-it-in-the-future" tendency.

**Hindsight bias**

Hindsight bias refers to the tendency we have, once information is made available to us, to think that we knew it all along. We've all fallen prey to this bias. An easy way to experience it is when we're doing practice questions and we don’t quite know answer to one of them is, so we turn to the solutions and "Ah, of course! It was so obvious, I knew this." This is what you made you so sure that you knew the correct answer to the question that you got wrong on the exam after the teacher told you what it was.

This bias is a pernicious one, because it's so easy to fall prey to even when you’re aware of it. It robs you of the subjective feeling of not knowing something, which we need, even if it’s unpleasant, because if we don’t have an accurate understanding of what we do and do not know we can’t allocate our precious time to those things we don’t know and, worse yet, we will think we know things we actually don’t.

This is why you should always be on high alert to make sure you don’t fall prey hindsight bias, because it doesn't allow you to make corrections to your learning since you never get to realize that something is wrong in the first place. If, prior to an event that triggers hindsight bias, your knowledge is at best shaky, hindsight bias will make it so that you judge that knowledge as certain, as something you know, when you in fact don't. Because of this, you carry on thinking that you do not need to review your knowledge to correct any misunderstandings and so when you actually need that knowledge, say in an exam, you won't have that knowledge to support you.

**Foresight bias**

If hindsight bias is the mistake of thinking one knew it all along, then foresight bias is the mistake of thinking we will know it in the future. Foresight bias stems from us being blind to the conditions that lead us to recall certain things in the first place. Let's take an example. When you are studying something you often have a book with you, or some notes, along with that endless repository of knowledge called the Internet. You're reading your notes, or the textbook, and you're fairly certain you've got this covered. The material feels familiar to you which must mean you already know this. Because you don’t want to waste your time on things you already know, you switch to something where you’re a bit shakier. The problem arises when the time comes you need to use the knowledge and you find that you don’t know it as well as you thought you did. Your mistake was in thinking that because the material felt familiar to you it must have meant not only that you knew it well, but that you would continue to know it in the future, when in fact that feeling of familiarity wasn’t a good indicator of the actual state of your knowledge.

Foresight bias arises because the environment you're in when you must call on that knowledge is oftentimes different from the one you studied it in. In an exam you no longer have access to your notebooks, your books, or the Internet. The room is different, the chair feels funny, and the table is written on with lewd comments from past students. Now you need to recall the material entirely from memory, and it suddenly feels like there's a roadblock impeding you from accessing it, which sucks because you were so certain you knew that material but, for some reason, now you don't.

Memory is cue-based. When you're learning something, you are creating new memories that are connected to certain cues based on your environment, or other knowledge that you associated them with. This means that if, for some reason, the cues to which those memories that you want to access are not present when you need them, say by going to an exam without your books, notebook, etc, then the likelihood of you accessing those memories is greatly impaired. As if your memories are like a door where the cues are keys that open it. If you don’t have the proper keys with you you can’t open the door.

Enter foresight bias. This bias works by combining the performance heuristic with the shallow cues that are present when you’re studying. What happens is that when you’re studying all those cues are available to you, making it so that your memories are easily brought forth to mind. Because we equate recall performance with learning, we assume that we know, at a deep level, that material, when in fact that effortless recall is just due to those cues being available. This presents an issue because if you feel like you know something, you will stop wasting your time with it, but, if that judgment is misplaced, by not making the efforts to make sure you actually learn what you’re trying to learn, when the time comes that you need that knowledge, like in an exam, you won’t have it, and you will end up failing because of a trick your brain played on you.

**What can you do?**

If it's so easy to fool ourselves into thinking we know things when we don't, it would be helpful if there were techniques we could use so that we're less vulnerable to those biases.

Thankfully, there are.

If hindsight bias works by making us mistake recognition for learning, then a way to make sure that our judgment of whether we know something or not is contingent on us actually knowing the material is to testing ourselves on it. Through testing ourselves we’re collapsing our judgment of whether we know something or not into a binary answer. Either we know something or we don't. If we know it, testing will give us a more reliable judgment of it than mere recognition could and, if for some reason our knowledge is more flimsy than we previously thought, testing will make sure you know you don't know the material as well as you thought you did. You will fail, and failure will unambiguously tell you what you need to do.

By testing yourself you will also be working to create memory cues that aren't incidental to the environment but that are internal instead. Because testing is more similar to the conditions in which you will need that knowledge, say on an exam, the likelihood of correct recall will be greater than if you don't test yourself because the cues those memories are now linked to are cues that will be also be available on the exam.

A nice takeaway for you to take from this is that your judgments of whether you know something or not should be based on your performance on tasks that are more like those where you’re going to be needing that knowledge and not on your subjective experience when your studying. You are easily fooled, so if you base your decisions on whether to continue studying or not based on whether it “feels” like you know it or not you will most likely end up being wrong. Much better to make those decisions after testing yourself on that knowledge because then you will truly know if you know something.
