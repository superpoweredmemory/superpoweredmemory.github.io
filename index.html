          <h2> A Research-Based Course on How To Master Your Memory</h2>
          <h3>Imagine how much more you could accomplish if you could remember everything you learn.</h3>
          <h3>What impact would that have in your job, in your studies, throughout your life?</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>Superpowered Memory is an online course on how to leverage the research findings of how memory works to teach you one of the most crucial skills in the 21st century: how to learn.</p>
          <p>We're always learning. Perhaps we want to get better at our job, or want a better one. A lot of our success in life is determined by the things we learn and bring to the table, yet we are never taught how to learn. We pick up on what people are doing and hope that it works as well for us as it does for them, oblivious to the fact that other people are just as clueless as we are.</p>
          <p> I want to teach you a smarter way to learn.</p>
          <p>The science of learning and memory is one of the most incredible successes in psychology. For decades researchers have been hard at work trying to understand how our memories work and the results have been nothing short of amazing. Our memories are well tuned machines that work according to well understood principles that can be taken advantage of.</p>
          <p> We now know what we have to do to never forget, and Superpowered Memory is going to teach you how. </p>
          <p>You will learn:</p>
