          <h2>How To Master Your Memory And Become an Effective Learner</h2>
          <p> If you're like most people, you weren't taught how to learn. </p>
          <p> You followed what advice your parents and teachers gave you, yet it never seems to work as it should. You never learn things as easily as others do, and you quickly forget what you do learn. </p>
          <p> You feel frustrated that even though you do all you've been told you're supposed to do, even after so many hours spent studying, you still don't get the results you want. You feel demoralized, and a little angry at yourself as well.</p>
          <p> I certainly did. </p>
          <p> I was a freshman at college when I realized that I was close to failing every class I was taking. I'm not going to lie, I felt like sh*t.</p>
          <p> There had to be a better way.</p>
          <h3> What took me 6 years of research and many dozens of hours to figure out: </h3>
          <p>Researchers have known for decades how we're supposed to be learning, but we're never taught of this. Here's a sample what they've found so far:</p>
          <h2><b>Spacing study sessions works better than massing them.</b></h2>
          <h2> <b> Testing yourself is much better than just rereading. </b></h2>
          <h2>  <b>Switching between subjects is better than focusing on a single one. </b></h2>
          <br></br>
          <p><strong><i>"Okay Jo√£o I hear you, but how am I supposed to actually use this myself?"</i></strong></p>
          <p> Superpowered Memory will teach you how to leverage these principles into the techniques and practices that will allow you not only to learn more effectively, but also to forever remember what you learn. My goal is to teach you not only how to learn better, but smarter.</p>

          <h3>Here's what we'll cover:</h3>
          <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span> The science of how your memory works.</h4>
          <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span> What learning techniques you should be using.</h4>
          <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span> How to use Spaced Repetition Systems to hack the learning process.</h4>
          <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span> How to turn this principles into an effective habit.</h4>
          <p>You will come out of Superpowered Memory with an understanding of how your memory works and what that implies about how you should approach your learning. You will learn the learning techniques that work, and how you can use Spaced Repetition Software to streamline the learning process so you can focus apply these learning principles without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
          <h3>Who's Superpowered Memory for?</h3>
          <p> Anyone who wants to improve how they learn. You can be a student who needs to know what you should be doing to improve your grades or someone who needs to learn new things for the job and wants to be more effective at it. I designed Superpowered Memory for anyone for whom learning is a crucial component of their lives. </p>
